... I decided to take advantage of an opportunity to create the Star Wars game I'd have loved to play.
No accounts, no micro-transactions, no ads or anything else, just a fun way to test your knowledge of this galaxy far, far away we love so much.
Two game modes, easy to understand but of a level worthy of our passion, and a system of daily challenges to compare your scores (after all, you need a reason to study, don't you?).
I hope you'll like it and may the Force be with you !
